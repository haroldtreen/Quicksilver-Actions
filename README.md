Custom scripts for Quicksilver, the Mac application launcher

# Evernote Logger
Born from the idea that I wanted to keep a log of all the things I learned in a day. I needed the entry to be quick and easy, so I decided to go with Quicksilver.

### How to Use
1. Copy EvernoteLogger.scpt to ~/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/Actions 
2. Enable the script through Preferences > Actions > Check "EvernoteLogger" 
3. Launch Quicksilver with whatever shortcut you've chosen 
4. Type '.' to go into text mode 
5. Enter the message you want appended to your note of the day 
6. Press tab to choose an action 
7. Type 'E' and EvernoteLogger should be one of the first actions filtered to. 
8. Hit Enter! 

The note will get created if it does not exist. Whatever text you entered into evernote will be appended to the end with a timestamp. Easy!
